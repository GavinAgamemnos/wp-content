# wp-content

Created a standard page template in /templates

Pulled JSON data to associative array and called relevant fields

Added Custom Fields for 'Buy Now' button, 'Awards Info' and 'Product info'

Added JS for the hamburger nav (common.js)

Added some mixins to the _helpers.scss (break points & colors)

Added a google font for aesthetics into the header

Took advantage of Bootstrap for the 'other retailers' drop down and page grid

Added a tools directory into the SCSS folder and then added a _tabs.scss for the tab section

Added a CSS only (accessible) tab module, could have used JS but decided a CSS only version has its own benefits

Added some light styling to the page

Tested against Google page speed for best practice and accessibility + W3C for validation
